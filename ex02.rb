# A comment, this is so that you can read your program later.
# Anything after the # is ignored by ruby.

puts "I could have code like this." # And the comment after is ignored.

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:
# puts "This won't run."

puts "This will run."

=begin
This is another way to do multi line comment,
however not recommended by Zed or the ruby community.
it starts with =begin,and has to end with =end
=end
