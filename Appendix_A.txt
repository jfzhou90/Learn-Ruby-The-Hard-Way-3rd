This is a crash course for command line using shell's VIM command

NEVER TYPE -rf / (it can destroy your computer - According to Zed Shaw) , it does remove folders (I think, never tried)
There are a few commands that was not taught in the book, I have them as ??? as of now, will update it when I encounter them in the future.

Here's a list of stuff to remember:

This is for Linux/osX only
pwd          - print working directory               (shows you which directory you're in)
hostname     - my computer's network name            (shows the network name)
mkdir        - make directory                        (making new folder)
cd           - change directory                      (going into the next or previous folder, cd ~ will return you to the main directory, cd .. will return you to the previous folder)y
ls           - list directory                        (a list of folders or files in the directory you're in)
rmdir        - remove directory                      (removes EMPTY folders only)
pushd        - push directory                        (a method to save the directory you're in, so you can switch back and forth)
popd         - pop directory                         (a method to remove the saved directory)
cp           - copy a file or directory              (Able to copy entire folder)
mv           - move a file or directory              (could also be used to rename)
less         - page through a file                   (???)
cat          - print the whole file                  (reads the text in the file)
xargs        - execute arguments                     (???)
find         - find files                            (???)
grep         - find things inside files              (???)
man          - read a manual page                    (??? wonder how that works)
apropos      - find what man page is appropriate     (???)
env          - look at your environment              (???)
echo         - print some arguments                  (???)
export       - export/set a new environment variable (???)
exit         - exit the shell                        (???)
sudo         - DANGER! become super user root DANGER!(???)
clear        - clears the screen                     (Clears the terminal screen)

This is for Windows only (I'm only typing the ones that are different than above, no explanation for them as I'm using OsX))
robocopy     - robust copy                           
more         - page through a file
type         - print the whole file
forfiles     - run a command on lots of files
dir -r       - find files
select-string- find things inside files
help         - read a manual page
helpctr      - find what man page is appropriate
set          - export/set a new environment variable
runas        - DANGER! become super user root DANGER!
